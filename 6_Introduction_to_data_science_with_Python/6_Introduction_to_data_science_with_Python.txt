6.1 Python basics
- lambda is an anonymous function
my function = lambda a,b,c (list of arguments): a + b (expression)

6.2 Basic processing with pandas
- useful links (Python blogs):

- to query data with pandas by numeric location (starting at zero), we use the iloc attribute
- to query data with pandas by the index label, we use the loc attribute
- with broadcasting, you can apply an operation to every value in the series, changing the series
- pandas works with numpy in the background and all mathematical functions are vectorized
- series is a one dimensional data structure in pandas
- dataframe is a two dimensional data structure in pandas (2 axes array)
- axis(0) - rows
- axis(1) - columns

6.3 Advanced processing with pandas
When inplace=True is passed, the data is renamed in place (it returns nothing),
so you'd use:
df.an_operation(inplace=True)

When inplace=False is passed (this is the default value, so isn't necessary),
 performs the operation and returns a copy of the object, so you'd use:
df = df.an_operation(inplace=False)
