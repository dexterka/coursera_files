(ok)1. Question 1
Which of the following is an example of clustering?
Separate the data into distinct groups by similarity

(ok)2. Question 2
Which of the following are advantages to using decision trees over other models? (Select all that apply)
Trees are easy to interpret and visualize
Trees often require less preprocessing of data

(ok)3. Question 3
What is the main reason that each tree of a random forest only looks at a random subset of the features when building each node?
To improve generalization by reducing correlation among the trees and making the model more robust to bias.

(ok)4. Question 4
Which of the following supervised machine learning methods are greatly affected by feature scaling? (Select all that apply)

Neural Networks
KNN
SVM

(ok)5. Question 5
Select which of the following statements are true.

For predicting future sales of a clothing line, Linear regression would be a better choice than a decision tree regressor.

For a model that won’t overfit a training set, Naive Bayes would be a better choice than a decision tree.


(ok) 6. Question 6
Match each of the prediction probabilities decision boundaries visualized below with the model that created them.
1.Neural Network
2.KNN (k=1)
3.Decision Tree

(ok)7. A decision tree of depth 2 is visualized below. Using the `value` attribute of each leaf, find the accuracy score for the tree of depth 2 and the accuracy score for a tree of depth 1. 

accuracy2 = 0,954209749
accuracy1 = 0,886755293
result = accuracy2 - accuracy1 = 0,067454456

(ok)8. Question 8
For the autograded assignment in this module, you will create a classifier to predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time (See the module 4 assignment notebook for a more detailed description). Which of the following features should be removed from the training of the model to prevent data leakage? (Select all that apply)

compliance_detail - More information on why each ticket was marked compliant or non-compliant
collection status

(ok)9. Question 9
Which of the following might be good ways to help prevent a data leakage situation?

Remove variables that a model in production wouldn’t have access to
Sanity check the model with an unseen validation set
If time is a factor, remove any data related to the event of interest that doesn’t take place prior to the event.

(ok)10. Question 10
Given the neural network below, find the correct outputs for the given values of x1 and x2.

The neurons that are shaded have an activation threshold, e.g. the neuron with >1? will be activated and output 1 if the input is greater than 1 and will output 0 otherwise.

x1	x2	output
0	0	0
0	1	1
1	0	1
1	1	0
